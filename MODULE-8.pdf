1. Explain Switch 

ANS-A network switch is a device that connects devices within a network, forwarding data packets based on MAC addresses.
 It operates at the data link layer (Layer 2), enabling efficient communication between devices in the same VLAN.
 Switches enhance network performance by reducing collisions and segmenting traffic.

2. Explain Switch Boot Sequence 

ANS-A Cisco switch boot sequence starts with the Power-On Self-Test (POST) to check hardware.
 The bootstrap loads the Cisco IOS from flash memory. The IOS initializes, loads the configuration from NVRAM, 
And starts interfaces.
 The switch then runs Spanning Tree Protocol and is ready for operation.


3. Explain Three Methods to access Switch Command Line 
Interface 

ANS-Three methods to access a Cisco switchâ€™s Command Line Interface (CLI) are:

 (a)Console: Connect via a console port using a rollover cable and terminal emulator (e.g., PuTTY) for direct access.
 (b)Telnet: Remotely access the CLI over the network using Telnet, requiring VTY configuration and an IP address.
 (c)SSH: Securely access the CLI remotely via SSH, needing VTY setup, IP, and crypto key generation.


4. Explain and Configuring the Cisco Internet Operating System 

ANS-Required command for configuring the cisco internet operating system are:
   enable
configure terminal
hostname Switch1
interface vlan 1
 ip address 192.168.1.2 255.255.255.0
 no shutdown
ip default-gateway 192.168.1.1
vlan 10
 name SALES
interface fastEthernet 0/1
 switchport mode access
 switchport access vlan 10
line vty 0 4
 transport input ssh
 login local
username admin secret cisco123
ip domain-name example.com
crypto key generate rsa
service password-encryption
write memory


5. Explain Switch Port 

ANS-A switch port is a physical interface on a network switch that connects devices like computers or other switches.
 It operates at Layer 2, forwarding frames based on MAC addresses. 
Ports can be configured as access (single VLAN) or trunk (multiple VLANs) modes,
 Supporting network segmentation and communication.
