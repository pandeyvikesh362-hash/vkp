6. What is the Physical structure of AD? 

ANS-Physical Structure of Active Directory (AD):
Active Directory's physical structure consists of:

(a)Domain Controllers (DCs)

.Servers that store AD database (NTDS.DIT) and authenticate users.


(b)Sites

.Logical grouping of well-connected subnets to control replication traffic.


(c)Site Links

.Connections between sites defining replication path and cost.


(d)Global Catalog (GC) Servers

.DCs hosting partial replicas of all domains for forest-wide queries.


(e)Replication Topology

.Automatic KCC-generated connections (intrasite & intersite) using RPC/IP.


7. What is the Logical components of Active Directory? 

ANS-Active Directory's logical components organize data hierarchically:

.Forest: Root container, shared schema, single security boundary.
.Domain: Security & replication boundary, unique namespace.
.Domain Tree: Contiguous domains sharing namespace.
.Organizational Units (OUs): Containers for objects, delegate administration.
.Objects: Users, groups, computers, GPOs.
.Schema: Defines object classes/attributes.
.Partitions: Configuration, Schema, Domain (replicated separately).


8. What is the Full form Of LDAP?

ANS-
LDAP stands for Lightweight Directory Access Protocol.


9. What is the location of the AD database? 

ANS-The Active Directory database file is:
NTDS.DIT
Default location:
 %SystemRoot%\NTDS\NTDS.DIT
 (Usually C:\Windows\NTDS\NTDS.DIT)
 Associated files in same folder:

.edb.log, edb.chk, temp.edb
.SYSVOL (at %SystemRoot%\SYSVOL) stores GPOs and scripts.


10. What is child DC?

ANS-Child Domain Controller (Child DC) is a Domain Controller (DC) in a child domain within an Active Directory forest.

.It authenticates users and replicates AD data only within its own child domain.
.Does not hold the full forest schema or configuration.
.Participates in intrasite and intersite replication with other DCs in the same domain.
.Example: sales.example.com is a child of example.com → DCs in sales.example.com are Child DCs.


11. Explain the term forest in AD

ANS-Forest in Active Directory (AD):
A forest is the top-level container in Active Directory, representing a complete AD instance.
Key Points:

.Contains one or more domains (root + child domains).
.Shares a common schema, configuration, and Global Catalog.
.Acts as a security boundary — trust between forests must be manually created.
.All domains in a forest automatically trust each other (transitive trusts).
.Single point of schema and configuration replication.

Example:
example.com (root) → sales.example.com, hr.example.com (child domains) = one forest.

25. What are Organizational Units (OUs) in Active Directory, and how do you use 
them?

ANS-
OUs in Active Directory are containers to organize users, groups, and computers.
Uses:

.Delegate administration (e.g., reset passwords in Sales OU).
.Apply GPOs (link policies to OU).
.Logical grouping by department/location.

How to use:

(a)Open ADUC → Right-click domain → New → OU.
(b)Move objects or create inside.
(c)Link GPOs or delegate control.
